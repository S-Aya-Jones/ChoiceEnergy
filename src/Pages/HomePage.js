          Speaking or writing about a source text contributes to deeper
          comprehension than merely reading since both actions require intense
          scrutiny and examination. Reading and then engaging in a meaningful
          and fruitful discussion with others challenges us to extend our
          thinking, arrive at new insights, and consider different perspectives.
          Writing about what we read requires critical thinking and active
          engagement in order to compose a coherent piece for a particular
          purpose and audience. Therefore, learning experiences that include
          writing, speaking, and listening tasks foster further introspection
          and analysis of text. Speaking or writing about a source text

          various writing, speaking, and listening ideas, such as annotation and
          peer conversations, questioning techniques, dialectical journals,
          graphic organizers, and reciprocal teaching sequences. What follows
          are additional writing opportunities, some of which include speaking
          and listening aspects, that extend students' understanding of the
          text. The emphasis on the link between reading and writing is rooted
          in sound research:
